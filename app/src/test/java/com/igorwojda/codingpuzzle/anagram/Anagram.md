(contains same characters and in the same quantity). Only consider characters, not spaces or punctuation.  Consider capital letters to be
the same as lower case


## Examples

```
anagrams('rail safety', 'fairy tales') --> True
anagrams('RAIL! SAFETY!', 'fairy tales') --> True
anagrams('Hi there', 'Bye there') --> False
```
