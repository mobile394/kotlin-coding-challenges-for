Write a function that accepts a positive Long `n`. The function should return a [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial).
Factorial is number that is created by multiplying all whole numbers from our chosen number `n` down to 1.

# Examples
```
factorial(-1) //return "Underflow error in factorial"
factorial(20) //return "Overflow error in factorial"
factorial(1) //return 1
factorial(2) //return 2
factorial(3) //return 6
```
