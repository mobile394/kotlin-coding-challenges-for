# Instructions
Given a string, return true if the string is a palindrome or false if it is not.  Palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is
reversed. Include spaces and punctuation in determining if the string is a palindrome. In this exercise we will allows one bad character.
Our string will be (tolerant) palindrome if after removing one character string is a palindrome.


# Examples
```
tolerantPalindrome("abba") == true
tolerantPalindrome("abb#a") == true
tolerantPalindrome("abcdefg") == false

```
