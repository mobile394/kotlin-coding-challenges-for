## Instructions

[Puzzle files](.)

Write a function which accepts an `list` of integers and a number called `n`. The function should calculate the maximum sum of `n`
continuous/consecutive elements in the `list` (`n` digits next to another that have the largest sum).

## Examples

```
maxSubListSum(listOf<Int>(), 3) // null
maxSubListSum(listOf(4, 2, 7), 2) // 9
maxSubListSum(listOf(4, 2, 7, 5, 8, 9, 5, 1), 3) // 22
```
