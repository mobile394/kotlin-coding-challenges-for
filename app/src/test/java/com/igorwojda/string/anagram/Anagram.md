# Annagram

## Instructions

Given two strings, implement a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name
formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as `cinema`, formed from `iceman`. Only consider characters, not spaces or punctuation.
Consider capital letters to be the same as lower case.
